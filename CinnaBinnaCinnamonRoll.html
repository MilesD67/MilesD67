    <h7>Preheat the oven to a preheated tempreture of 1000 degrees. Mix the baking powder with the cinnamon and white flower until the mix is mixed. Then put in the water, ostrich egg, and butter and heat it so its heated at 300 degrees. Then add the 200 grams of salt and 50 grams of diabetic sugar in to the mixed mix. Next put in the white duck to tenderize the mixture and leave out for 30 days to oxidize. Dispose of the substance and then make your white duck go to the store and buy cinnamon rolls and come back, and you just made cinnamon rolls!</h7>
